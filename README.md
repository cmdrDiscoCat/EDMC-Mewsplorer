# EDMC-Mewsplorer
ED Market Connector plugin that lists every body you discovered in the system you're scanning, with their type (ww, elw, gg) and a mention if they're terraformable.

Get the zip file of this repository, extract it and copy the folder EDMC-Mewsplorer in the EDMC plugin directory (***not the one in the app's folder in Program Files but the one accessible by a button in EDMC's preferences window, in the "plugins" tab***).

Restart ED Market Connector.

That's it.
